      " * Image manipulation (e.g., object removal, super-resolution)\n",
      " * Video editing (e.g., color correction, motion tracking)\n",
      "3. **Chatbots and Customer Service**: Generative AI can power chatbots that can understand and respond to customer inquiries in a more human-like way.\n",
      "4. **Personalization**: Generative AI can be used to personalize content and experiences for customers based on their preferences, behavior, and demographics.\n",
      "5. **Marketing and Advertising**: Generative AI can be used to generate:\n",
      " * Ad creative (e.g., images, videos, copy)\n",
      " * Social media ads\n",
      " * Email marketing campaigns\n",
      "6. **Data Augmentation**: Generative AI can be used to augment existing data sets, making them more diverse and representative.\n",
      "7. **Predictive Analytics**: Generative AI can be used to generate predictions for business outcomes such as sales forecasts or customer churn probabilities.\n",
      "8. **Influencer Marketing**: Generative AI can be used to generate influencer content (e.g., product showcases, testimonials) that is tailored to specific audiences.\n",
      "9. **Automated Content Writing**: Generative AI can be used to automate content writing tasks for websites, blogs, and other publications.\n",
      "10. **Creative Industries**: Generative AI can be used in creative industries such as music composition, film scoring, or art generation.\n",

    "\n",
    "It seems strange, right? We just used OpenAI code to call Ollama?? What's going on?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."
